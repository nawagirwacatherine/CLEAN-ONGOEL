 THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE YOUTH  GROUP(IYPG)


We, as tomorrow’s decision-makers, must raise awareness towards peace and speak up our voices. Particularly, IPYG to ensure peace and cessation of war through DPCW, we are supporting and promoting it.
IPYG has vision s based on five missions. It is decided by the Declaration of World peace proclaimed by the chairman Lee of HWPL in 2013.

Vision.
1. For youth to protect themselves from threats around the world. (violence and conflicts)
2. For youth to leave as legacy/inheritance future generation. (We are Tomorrow’s Decision-Makers

Mission.
1. To unite as one through the IPYG
2. To harmonize transcending race, religion, ideology
3. To empower the youth(youth empowerment)
4. To spread peace education
5. To be the pioneers for peace culture

In favor of his saying, to speak up our voices to the world, we should unite as one through the IPYG.
And, people refuse to acknowledge each difference and it could lead them to cause wars after all. The world is caught a vicious circle over and over. There are a number of wars caused by religion, actually. So, we’ve been trying to bring harmony by attending HWPL WARP office.

Youth should be empowered to make voices for the future they want.  Whoever should be noteworthy the peace since the childhood then they can know how important peace is and further it can spread over the world. Therefore, we foster the peace by spreading peace education.
